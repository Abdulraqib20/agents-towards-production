# ðŸ§  Agent Memory with Redis

Build a **memory-enabled AI agent** that remembers user preferences and learns from conversations using Redis and LangGraph.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Learn

The goal of this tutorial is to empower you with a **horizontal concept** that you can apply to your own agent use cases.

- **Dual-Memory Architecture**: Implement short-term (conversation state) and long-term (persistent knowledge) memory
- **Semantic Search**: Use RedisVL for semantic memory retrieval with embeddings
- **Memory Types**: Understand differences between episodic (user experiences) vs semantic (general knowledge) memory patterns
- **Production Patterns**: Tool-based memory management and conversation summarization
- **LangGraph Integration**: Build complete workflows with Redis checkpointers for state persistence


## ðŸš€ Run in Google Colab

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NirDiamant/agents-towards-production-private/blob/main/tutorials/agent-memory-with-redis/agent_memory_tutorial.ipynb)


## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

- **OpenAI API Key** (with billing enabled)
- **Redis** optionally installed in Colab, or use [Redis Cloud](https://redis.io/try-free/?utm_source=nir&utm_medium=cpa&utm_campaign=2025-05-ai_in_production-influencer-nir&utm_content=sd-software_download-7013z000001WaRY)

## ðŸŽ“ What You'll Build

A travel agent that:
- Remembers user preferences across conversations
- Stores long term memories ("I prefer Delta airlines") 
- Provides personalized recommendations based on past interactions
- Manages conversation context automatically

**Total Tutorial Time**: ~30-45 minutes  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate (Python, LangGraph, Tool calling, other basic AI concepts)
