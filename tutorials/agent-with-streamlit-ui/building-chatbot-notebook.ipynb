    "# Building a Chatbot AI Agent with OpenAI and Streamlit\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wanted to create your own chatbot like ChatGPT? In this tutorial, we will build a simple AI chatbot from scratch using OpenAI's API (which provides powerful language models like GPT-3.5) and Streamlit (a Python library for creating web apps).\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll have a beginner-friendly chatbot that runs in your browser, with a chat interface for conversations and a file uploader for sharing files with the bot. We'll go step-by-step, explaining every part of the code so even absolute beginners can follow along.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we'll build:**\n",
    "- A web application where you can type messages to an AI agent and receive responses\n",
    "- The interface will resemble a chat window (like messaging apps)\n",
    "- An option to upload a file (for example, a text file) that your chatbot could potentially use\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this guide is on using Streamlit to create a clean and simple UI and integrating it with OpenAI's API to handle the chatbot's intelligence. Let's get started!"

    "\n",
    "- Python 3.x installed on your system\n",
    "- An OpenAI API key (required to access OpenAI's language model). You can get one by creating an account on OpenAI's website and generating an API key\n",
    "- Basic knowledge of Python (functions, variables) â€“ we will explain everything, but it helps to understand simple Python syntax\n",

    "## Setup: OpenAI API Key\n",
    "\n",
    "To use OpenAI's API, you need to provide your API key so that the library can authenticate. There are a couple of ways to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Option 1 (Recommended)**: Set the API key as an environment variable on your system (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`). This keeps the key out of your code.\n",
    "   - On Linux/Mac: `export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_key_here'` in your terminal\n",
    "   - On Windows: `set OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your_key_here\"` in the Command Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Option 2**: Directly assign the API key in your code (quick for testing, but be careful not to expose your key if you share your code)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll assume you saved your key as an environment variable for safety. It's a best practice to avoid hard-coding secrets."

We provide one message â€“ the user's prompt â€“ and specify its role as \"user\". You can also include a \"system\" message to prime the AI's behavior (for example, telling it to act as a friendly assistant), but we'll keep it simple for now.\n",
    "- We chose the model \"gpt-4o\" which is the same model behind ChatGPT and is suitable for chat interactions.\n",
    "- The OpenAI API returns a response object that contains the AI's reply. The actual text of the reply is nested inside `response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]`. We extract that and return it.\n",
    "- The `print(test_reply)` line is just to verify that everything is working. It will print the AI's answer to \"Hello, how are you?\" in the console. When running as a Streamlit app, we won't use print; this is just a sanity check.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, if you run this code in a regular Python environment (replacing the test prompt as needed and ensuring your API key is set), you should see a text response from the AI. This confirms our OpenAI integration works. Now that the AI agent part is ready, let's build the web interface using Streamlit."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on building your first AI chatbot with Streamlit and OpenAI! ðŸŽ‰ In this tutorial, we covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Installing and setting up the necessary libraries (streamlit and openai)\n",
    "- Obtaining and using an OpenAI API key to access a GPT-4o model\n",
    "- Writing a function to communicate with the OpenAI API and get responses\n",
    "- Using Streamlit to create a web interface, including a chat message display and input box, as well as a file uploader in the sidebar\n",
    "- Maintaining state (conversation history) across interactions using st.session_state, enabling a multi-turn conversation\n",
    "- Running the Streamlit app and interacting with the chatbot through your browser\n",
    "\n",
    "This basic app provides a foundation that you can extend in many ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improve the AI's context**: We kept the AI calls stateless (only sending the latest user prompt). You could send the whole conversation in the messages to ChatCompletion.create so the AI remembers previous questions.\n",
    "- **Use the uploaded file**: Integrate the file content into the conversation. For example, if a PDF is uploaded, extract its text and prepend it as a system message.\n",
    "- **UI enhancements**: Streamlit's chat elements support things like avatars and you can add more design elements (colors, sidebar info, etc.).\n",
    "- **Deployment**: You can easily deploy this app to the web (for example, using Streamlit Cloud) and share your chatbot with friends or colleagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "With relatively few lines of code, we created an interactive AI assistant! Feel free to experiment and build on this. Happy coding, and enjoy chatting with your new AI chatbot! ðŸš€"
