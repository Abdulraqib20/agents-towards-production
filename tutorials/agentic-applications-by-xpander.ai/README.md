# Build Real-World AI Agents with xpander.ai

**xpander.ai** is a Backend-as-a-Service platform that lets you build, deploy, and scale production-ready AI agents‚Äîwithout worrying about infrastructure.

xpander.ai offers Backend-as-a-Service infrastructure for autonomous agents: memory, tools, multi-user state, various agent triggering options (MCP, A2A, API, Web interfaces), storage, agent-to-agent messaging ‚Äî designed to support any agent framework and SDK.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| üõ†Ô∏è **Framework Flexibility** | Choose from popular frameworks like OpenAI ADK, Agno, CrewAI, LangChain, or work directly with native LLM APIs |
| üß∞ **Tool Integration** | Access our comprehensive MCP-compatible tools library and pre-built integrations |
| üöÄ **Scalable Hosting** | Deploy and scale your agents effortlessly on our managed infrastructure |
| üíæ **State Management** | Opt for framework-specific local state or leverage our distributed state management system |
| ‚ö° **Real-time Events** | Harness our event streaming capabilities for Slackbots, ChatUIs, Agent2Agent communication, and Webhook integrations |
| üõ°Ô∏è **API Guardrails** | Implement robust guardrails using our Agent-Graph-System to define and manage dependencies between API actions of tool-use |

By abstracting away infrastructure complexity, xpander.ai empowers you to focus on what matters most: building intelligent, effective, production-ready AI agents.
